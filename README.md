# University of Wisconsin - Madison CS Projects

This repo contains links to (mostly) all of my coding work from undergrad @ University of Wisconsin - Madison. 

## CS 300 - Programming II 

Java based course covering basic logic and data structures -> https://github.com/nosmith18/CS300 

## CS 400 - Programming III

Java based course covering more advanced logic, data structures, and algorithms applicable to them -> https://github.com/nosmith18/CS400

## CS 577 - Algorithms

If you took Hell and converted it into word problems requiring the most theoretical, edge case, mind mincing solutions currently known to man in the CS realm... these small projects are something random they made us do -> https://github.com/nosmith18/CS300. The actual class material was strictly worksheets and pseudocode theory
